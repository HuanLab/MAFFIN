\title{Calculate pooled RSD for normalization evaluation.}
\usage{
EvaPRSD(FeatureTable, GroupNames, SampleInCol = TRUE, output = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{FeatureTable}{Feature intensity table with features in row and samples in column (default).}

\item{GroupNames}{A character vector indicating the names of each group.}

\item{SampleInCol}{\code{TRUE} if samples are in column. \code{FALSE} if samples are in row.}

\item{output}{\code{TRUE} will output the result table in current working directory}
}
\value{
This function will return a vector that contains the calculated PRSDs for all features.
}
\description{
Calculate pooled relative standard deviation for each metabolic feature.
}
\details{
\code{FeatureTable} contains measured signal intensities of metabolic features,
with features in row and samples in column (default). The column names should
be sample names, and the first row should be sample group names (e.g. control, case).\cr
The first column should be unique feature identifiers.
An example of \code{FeatureTable} is provided as \code{TestingData} in this package.
